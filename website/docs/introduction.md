This is a limited training module to better understand the complexity of cultural competency in the American healthcare system and what you, if you are working in healthcare, can do to help bring equitable treatment to the American healthcare system.

## The Problem
Healthcare workers (ie doctors) discriminate against patients with diverse backgrounds because of a lack of training in cultural and religious sensitivities in both their hospitals and medical schools. This can result in a less-than-optimal patient experience and may even lead to ineffective medical treatment of patients that can potentially endanger their lives and leave medical practices open to legal ramifications. 

There is also a gap in prominent organizations that address the discrimination patients face in the healthcare system. There are few inexpensive defensive mechanisms for patients other than filing a complaint or seeing a different doctor.

Surprisingly, this issue is largely unexplored. With this in mind, we hope our claims will be taken seriously and incite dialogue by those in the health policy world. The issue of discrimination in health care is prevalent, and we strive to inspire much needed media coverage and policy making.
